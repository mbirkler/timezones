#Timezones

This plugin ensures good management of timezones. Is a must when GLPi is used worldwide.

##Compliance:

Version 1.3.0:
GLPI: 0.83, 0.84, 0.85, 0.90 | PHP: 5 | locale: en

Version 2.0.0:
GLPI: 0.85, 0.90, 9.1 | PHP: 5, 7 | locale: en, fr

##Installation procedure:
Like any other GLPi plugin: you must copy the package to the plugins folder, and don't forget to rename the downloaded folder into the right name: "timezones" instead of timezones-master or timezones-x.x.x like by default github will download it to you.

Beware also that sometimes the 'Enable' button on the GLPi plugin setup page is not usable: try to press F5 (page reload) to view the right message from the timezones plugin.

Thank you
